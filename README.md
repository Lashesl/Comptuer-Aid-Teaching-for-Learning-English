# Comptuer-Aid-Teaching-for-Learning-English

Purpose:

Design a multi-account system where user can login & register, learn English words, phrases, and sentences with different levels, and review what they have learned before. Users can register and login to start their English learning with different difficulty levels. After users finishing their each stage of learning, the system will review mistakes what they have made before to help user learning.

Solution:

Based on C++ with data structure. User information and English learning materials will be stored in the database which can be updated. Users' learning status will be recorded by a status word. Different difficulty levels of English learning are decided by the length of words, phrases, and sentences. Each users' learning content will be randomly choosed from database.

CAT_English.cpp is the main code.
